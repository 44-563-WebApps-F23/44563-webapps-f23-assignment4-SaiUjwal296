<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
</p>
<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
    morsel of dinner.</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p><div class="direction">[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</div> Nor I.
    But what is to be done now?</p>

<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
    utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.</p>

<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
    nevertheless.</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
    of that.</p>

<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>Well, as I say, I am not accustomed to affairs of the kind. But
    I should certainly think--</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>Out of the house she must go, and that immediately. That is
    as clear as daylight--</p>

<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>Yes, of course she must.</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>But where to? It would not be right to--</p>

<h3>MANDERS.</h3> <p>Where to? Home to her father, of course.</p>

<h3>MRS. ALVING.</h3> <p>To whom did you say?</p>
